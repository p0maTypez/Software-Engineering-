        <p>A secure password generation system can assist users in creating strong, virtually uncrackable passwords for their online accounts. The system will prompt users to select certain criteria for their desired password, such as length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Many websites and services require passwords to meet specific complexity rules, such as being at least eight characters long with a mix of character types. The password generator will allow users to change the password characteristics to meet these requirements. Once the criteria is selected, the system will generate a random string that adheres to the specific parameters. This will result in a password that is extremely difficult for malicious parties to guess. This system will increase security and also save users time when creating their own passwords.</p>

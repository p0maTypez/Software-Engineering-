        <p>Bolaji M. Adesiyan: Hello, I’m Bolaji, I’m a final year CS student who is still somewhat undecided in my career but also looking into cyber security. I have experience in java and some as well in html Throughout my academic journey, I've been fascinated by the endless possibilities within the realm of computer science, constantly exploring new avenues to expand my knowledge. While I haven't yet pinpointed my ultimate career path, the allure of cybersecurity has captured my attention, prompting me to delve deeper into its complexities and potential opportunities for impact. Exploring this field ignites my curiosity and drives me to acquire new skills and insights to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving digital landscape.

<p>Anthony C. Casanave: 
Hello, my name is Tony and  I am a senior in the GSU CS program. I will be graduating in 
December 2024. I have interned and worked as a web manager for 2.5 years at a small outdoor networking company. I started my college career as a psychology student (which I earned a bachelors degree in), and following that, decided to switch careers to Computer Science. I have enjoyed the process of learning the fundamentals of front-end and back-end development. I am interested in pursuing cybersecurity or web development once I finish college, but I am also open to other sectors related to CS and technology. <p>

<p>Elijah Hardin: 
Hello, my name is Elijah. I’m an aspiring web developer, and I also want to create my own ecommerce website. I hopefully will be graduating in the fall semester pending 5 more classes. I want to further develop my coding capabilities to be more versatile in high level working environments. I'm creative at heart, so I enjoy brainstorming many different ideas and trying to figure out how to make them come to life. I know that honing my coding skills will help me do that. I have some skills in python, java, html, and c as well, however I want to improve on each of them.<p>

<p>Sophia Noh: 
Hello, my name is Sophia Noh. I am a 4th-year computer science major at GSU looking to graduate in the Fall of 2024 with a passion for building innovative solutions through code. I aspire to work in the software engineering industry, but I am also interested in web development and UI/UX. I am constantly trying to improve my technical capabilities in coding and I am always open to learning new things. Over the course of my studies, I've delved into Python, Java, C, and HTML, honing my skills in both frontend and backend development. I thrive at problem-solving, and I'm excited to contribute my strengths to this project.<p>

<p> Amara M. Sawane:
Hello, My name is Amara M. Sawane. I am a senior in college and should be graduating by fall of 2024. I am an aspiring web developer as well as game developer. In terms of work I have made pixel art for a game that has been made already and a game that should be made later next semester. For web development I have made a website for the capoeira club at GSU and for a class at Benedict College. I would love to get more experience and to become a better coder throughout my time working with this group and in my actual career later in life.<p>
